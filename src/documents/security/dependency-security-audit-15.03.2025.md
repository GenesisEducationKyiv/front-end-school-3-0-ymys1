## 2. Security Compliance

### Verified Standards:

- All dependencies were verified using multiple trusted sources:
  - `npm audit`
  - GitHub Security Advisories
  - [Snyk](https://snyk.io/)
  - [Socket.dev](https://socket.dev/)
- No zero-day vulnerabilities found
- Lock file (`package-lock.json`) is committed to the repository
- No deprecated packages detected

### Secure Development Practices:

- Input validation is handled via **Zod**
- Strong typing is enforced using **TypeScript**
- ESLint ensures code quality and type-safe rules
- No use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `innerHTML`, or unsafe DOM APIs
- Build process uses **Vite + tsc** and includes linting and type checks
- Automated and manual security checks are in place

## 3. Suggested Dependency Replacement

### Current Library: `clsx`

- Purpose: Conditional className utility
- Limitation: Minimal functionality, lacks support for variants

### Suggested Replacement: `tailwind-variants`

#### Benefits:

- Built on top of `class-variance-authority` (already used)
- Adds support for **variants, states, and sizes**
- Enhances scalability in large design systems
- Type-safe, maintained, and verified on [Socket.dev](https://socket.dev/npm/package/tailwind-variants)

#### Security Evaluation:

- 0 vulnerabilities on Snyk, GitHub, Socket.dev
- Maintained, typed, and minimal dependencies

#### Migration Steps:

```bash
npm remove clsx
npm install tailwind-variants
```

#### Example Refactor:

**Before (clsx):**
```tsx
clsx('p-2', isActive && 'bg-blue-500')
```

**After (tailwind-variants):**
```tsx
import { tv } from 'tailwind-variants';

const button = tv({
  base: 'p-2',
  variants: {
    active: {
      true: 'bg-blue-500',
    },
  },
});

<button className={button({ active: true })} />
```

## Summary

- All dependencies are secure, up-to-date, and verified using multiple vulnerability databases
- No signs of zero-day or critical vulnerabilities
- Recommended practices are applied in both codebase and toolchain
- `tailwind-variants` is proposed as a scalable and secure replacement for `clsx`
