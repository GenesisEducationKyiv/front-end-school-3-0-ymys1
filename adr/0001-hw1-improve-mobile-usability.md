**Improve Mobile Usability by Implementing Responsive Design**

  Right now application looks well on desktop but lacks responsive design for mobile. The poor usability on smaller devices negatively impacts user experience (users can't easily browse, play, or explore music on mobile), accessibility and reach (many users access music platforms from mobile devices), user retention (frustration leads to drop-offs) and market competitiveness(industry standard expects responsive design).

**Decision**

  We will implement responsive design principles across all key views and components, ensuring proper rendering and usability for mobile and tablet devices. This will include:

- Refactoring layout using responsive utilities;  
- Adjusting key UI components  to scale or stack correctly on small screens;  
- Testing and verifying mobile usability using browser emulators and real devices.

---

**Rationale**

We chose this path because:

- It directly addresses the usability and accessibility problems on mobile.  
- No new libraries or technologies are required â€” the current tech stack supports responsive design.  
- Responsive design is a widely adopted best practice, aligning with user expectations.  
- Competitors in the music space offer seamless mobile experiences, and we must keep up.

Rejected alternatives:

- Creating a separate mobile app: Would increase long-term maintenance and development cost.  
- Maintaining desktop-only focus: Ignores a significant user base, especially as mobile traffic increases.  
    
    
  **Consequences**

Positive:

- Improved user experience across all devices.  
- Increased user retention and engagement from mobile users.  
- Enhanced accessibility and market reach.  
- No significant cost increase due to use of existing stack and components.

Negative:

- Short-term refactoring effort required.  
- Potential for bugs/regressions if not thoroughly tested.  
- Minor learning curve for team members unfamiliar with responsive techniques.
